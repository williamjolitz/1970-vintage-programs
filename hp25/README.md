The [HP 25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-25) was a pocket programmable calculator I owned in the 1970's-80's.

You wrote up programs on a blank template and keyed them in. These pics are of one sheet, both sides.

So I key'ed this in by hand to [sydney smith's HP25 emulator] (http://www.sydneysmith.com/products/hp25u/run/index.html). 
Attempted to use the program - it does work!

And I remembered why I'd made it, what it was for.

NASA's Dr. Gordon Auguson had myself and Eric Lee fabricate an 9" oscillating hyperbolic secondary mirror out of aluminum
for the Kuiper High Altitude Observatory (a 36" cassegrain in a modified C-141 cargo jet that flew it above the troposphere),
where it would gather far infrared radiation to a liquid Helium bathed bolometer.

This program was used to check the "figure" of the mirror, by giving the saggital depth of a radial zone from the center of the mirror.

So we'd use a precision (0.0001") gauge on a precision surface to get the sagittal measurements and spot check them with this program.

Now to translate this into a text form.
