Programs I wrote back in the 1970's from personal files

So, I'm going through old boxex, and I've been finding programs I wrote on all sorts of oddball machines. What better place for it than github!

I really have no idea of where this will go, but these bits of paper won't last forever (and do they need to?). So I'll capture them as snaps, enhance to read, and attempt to transpose into text. Perhaps I'll find an interpreter/VM to even test run them someday.
